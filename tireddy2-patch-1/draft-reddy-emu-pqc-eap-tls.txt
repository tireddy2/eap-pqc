1.  Introduction

   The emergence of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)
   would break the mathematical assumptions that underpins widely
   deployed public-key algorithms, rendering them insecure and obsolete.
   As a result, there is an urgent need to update protocols and
   infrastructure with post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms
   designed to resist attacks from both quantum and classical
   adversaries.  The cryptographic primitives requiring replacement are
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers], and the NIST PQC
   Standardization process has initially selected algorithms such as ML-
   KEM, SLH-DSA, and ML-DSA for usage in security protocols.

   To mitigate the risks posed by a CRQC, such as the potential
   compromise of encrypted data and the forging of digital signatures,
   existing security protocols must be upgraded to support PQC.  These
   risks include "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) attack, where
   adversaries capture encrypted traffic today with the intent to
   decrypt it once CRQCs become available.  Protocols such as EAP-TLS
   and EAP-TTLS are widely used for network access authentication in
   Enterprise and Wireless environments.  To continue providing long-
   term confidentiality and authentication guarantees, EAP-TLS and EAP-
   TTLS must evolve to incorporate post-quantum algorithms.

   However, transitioning these protocols to support PQC introduces
   practical challenges.  [RFC9191] highlights issues related to large
   certificates and certificate chains in EAP-TLS, which can lead to
   session failures due to round-trip limitations.  PQC certificates and
   certificate chains tend to be significantly larger than their
   traditional counterparts, further exacerbating these issues by
   increasing TLS handshake sizes and the likelihood of session
   failures.  To address these challenges, this draft proposes
   mitigation strategies that enable the use of PQC within EAP-TLS and
   EAP-TTLS, ensuring secure and efficient authentication even in
   constrained network environments.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document adopts terminology defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology].  For the purposes of this
   document, it is useful to categorize cryptographic algorithms into
   three distinct classes:

   *  Traditional Algorithm: An asymmetric cryptographic algorithm based
      on integer factorization, finite field discrete logarithms, or
      elliptic curve discrete logarithms.  In the context of TLS, an
      example of a traditional key exchange algorithm is Elliptic Curve
      Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), which is almost exclusively used in its
      ephemeral mode, referred to as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
      Ephemeral (ECDHE).

   *  Post-Quantum Algorithm: An asymmetric cryptographic algorithm
      designed to be secure against attacks from both quantum and
      classical computers.  An example of a post-quantum key exchange
      algorithm is the Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-
      KEM).

   *  Hybrid Algorithm: We distinguish between key exchanges and
      signature algorithms:

      -  Hybrid Key Exchange: A key exchange mechanism that combines two
         component algorithms - one traditional algorithm and one post-
         quantum algorithm.  The resulting shared secret remains secure
         as long as at least one of the component key exchange
         algorithms remains unbroken.

      -  PQ/T Hybrid Digital Signature: A multi-algorithm digital
         signature scheme composed of two or more component signature
         algorithms, where at least one is a post-quantum algorithm and
         at least one is a traditional algorithm.

   Digital signature algorithms play a critical role in X.509
   certificates, Certificate Transparency Signed Certificate Timestamps,
   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) statements, and any other
   mechanism that contributes signatures during a TLS handshake or in
   context of a secure communication establishment.

3.  Data Confidentiality in EAP-TLS

   One of the primary threats to EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS is the HNDL
   attack.  In this scenario, adversaries can passively capture EAP-TLS
   handshakes such as those transmitted over the air in Wi-Fi networks
   and store them for future decryption once CRQCs become available.

   While EAP-TLS 1.3 [RFC9190] was designed to provide strong forward
   secrecy and protect user privacy by encrypting client identity and
   reducing exposure of session metadata, HNDL attacks effectively
   nullify these protections.  If the handshake is not quantum-
   resistant, a future CRQC could retroactively decrypt session traffic,
   revealing:

   *  The identity of the authenticated client.

   *  Client credentials used in certificate-based authentication (e.g.,
      usernames, device or organization identifiers).

   To preserve the intended privacy guarantees of TLS 1.3 and protect
   against HNDL, EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS deployments MUST adopt post-
   quantum key exchange mechanisms, as outlined in Section 4 of
   [I-D.reddy-uta-pqc-app].  These mechanisms ensure that even if
   handshake data is recorded today, it cannot be decrypted in the
   future, maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of the TLS
   session.

   Furthermore, to support hybrid or PQC-only key exchange in bandwidth
   or latency-constrained EAP deployments, EAP clients and servers
   should apply the optimizations described in Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.reddy-uta-pqc-app] to minimize performance overhead.

4.  Post-Quantum Authentication in EAP-TLS

   Although CRQCs could eventually decrypt recorded TLS sessions to
   recover derived keys and access confidential data, they cannot
   retroactively compromise client or server authentication if the
   attacker did not possess the corresponding private key at the time of
   the handshake.  However, EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS deployments rely on
   X.509 certificates issued by certificate authorities (CAs), and the
   transition to post-quantum (PQ) authentication is constrained by the
   long lifecycle involved to distribute, deploy, and validate new trust
   anchors.  If CRQCs arrive sooner than anticipated, authentication
   systems may lack the agility to adapt in time.

   This makes PQC authentication a critical requirement for EAP-TLS and
   EAP-TTLS deployments deployments.  An on-path attacker equipped with
   a CRQC could compute a server’s private key before the certificate
   expires, enabling real-time impersonation of access points (APs).
   This could deceive users into revealing credentials or connecting to
   rogue networks, leading to privacy violations and potential client
   credential theft.

   To mitigate these risks, EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS deployments MUST adopt
   either pure PQ or PQ/T certificate-based authentication, as described
   in Section 5 of [I-D.reddy-uta-pqc-app].

   A composite certificate contains both a traditional public key
   algorithm (e.g., ECDSA) and a post-quantum algorithm (e.g., ML-DSA)
   within a single X.509 certificate.  This design enables both
   algorithms to be used in parallel, the traditional component ensures
   compatibility with existing infrastructure, while the post-quantum
   component introduces resistance against future quantum attacks.  This
   approach facilitates early adoption of PQC without requiring
   immediate disruption to established PKI deployments.

   The use of post-quantum or hybrid certificates increases the size of
   individual certificates, certificate chains, and signatures,
   resulting in significantly larger handshake messages.  These larger
   payloads can lead to packet fragmentation, retransmissions, and
   handshake delays, issues that are particularly disruptive in
   constrained or lossy network environments.

   To address these impacts, EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS deployments can apply
   certificate chain optimization techniques outlined in Section 6.1 of
   [I-D.reddy-uta-pqc-app] to reduce transmission overhead and improve
   handshake reliability.

5.  EST Integration

   The EAP-client is expected to validate the certificate presented by
   the EAP-server using a trust anchor that is provisioned out-of-band
   prior to authentication (e.g., using EST).  The Intermediate
   certificates are provided by the EAP server during the EAP-TLS
   handshake.  The EAP client relies solely on the pre-provisioned trust
   anchor to build and validate the certificate chain.  This model
   assumes a managed deployment environment with explicitly configured
   trust relationships between the EAP-client and EAP-server.

   To further reduce handshake overhead, particularly in deployments
   using large certificate chains due to post-quantum (PQ) or composite
   certificates, this draft proposes an optimization that leverages the
   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) protocol [RFC7030], extended
   by [RFC8295].  Specifically, it allows intermediate certificates to
   be retrieved in advance by using EST, thereby avoiding the need to
   transmit them during each EAP-TLS exchange.

   This section defines extensions to EST to support retrieval of the
   certificate chain used by a EAP server and EAP clients.  The first
   extension enables clients to obtain access to the complete set of
   published intermediate certificates of the EAP server.

   A new path component is defined under the EST well-known URI:

   GET /.well-known/est/eapservercertchain

   The '/eapservercertchain' is intended for informational retrieval
   only and does not require client authentication.  It allows clients
   to retrieve the intermediate certificate chain that the EAP server
   presents during TLS handshakes.  This request is performed using the
   HTTPS protocol.  The EST server MUST support requests without
   requiring client authentication.  The certificate chain provided by
   the EST server MUST be the same certificate chain EAP server uses in
   a EAP-TLS or EAP-TTLS session.

   The second extension enables EAP servers to obtain access to the
   complete set of published intermediate certificates of the EAP
   clients.  Rather than relying on static configuration, the EAP server
   can dynamically fetch the client's intermediate certificate chain
   from a trusted EST server within the same administrative domain.

   A new path component is defined under the EST well-known URI:

   GET /.well-known/est/eapclientcertchain

   The '/eapclientcertchain' is intended for informational retrieval
   only and does not require client authentication.  It allows EAP
   server to retrieve the intermediate certificate chain that the EAP
   clients present during TLS handshakes.  This request is performed
   using the HTTPS protocol.  The EST server MUST support requests
   without requiring client authentication.  The certificate chain
   provided by the EST server MUST be the same certificate chain EAP
   clients use in the EAP-TLS or EAP-TTLS session.

   EAP servers and clients are RECOMMENDED to cache retrieved
   certificate chains to reduce latency and network overhead.  However,
   they SHOULD implement mechanisms to detect changes or expiration.
   These include periodic re-fetching, honoring HTTP cache control
   headers (e.g., Cache-Control, ETag), and verifying the validity
   period of intermediate certificates.

   As an alternative, a device MAY attempt to retrieve the certificate
   chain from the EST server (e.g., /eapservercertchain or
   /eapclientcertchain) only when certificate validation fails during an
   EAP-TLS or EAP-TTLS handshake.  While this on-demand retrieval can
   serve as a fallback to recover from outdated intermediate
   certificate, it has the drawback of delaying authentication.

   After retrieving intermediate certificates via EST, a EAP client that
   believes it has a complete set of intermediate certificates to
   authenticate the EAP server sends the tls_flags extension as defined
   in [I-D.kampanakis-tls-scas-latest] with the 0xTBD1 flag set to 1 in
   its ClientHello message.  Similarly, a EAP server that believes it
   has a complete set of intermediate certificates to authenticate the
   EAP client sends the same tls_flags extension with 0xTBD1 set to 1 in
   its CertificateRequest message.  In both cases, only the end-entity
   certificates will be provided by the EAP client and server during the
   TLS handshake, relying on the recipient to possess or retrieve the
   necessary intermediate certificates for certificate chain validation.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations outlined in [I-D.reddy-uta-pqc-app] and
   [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers] must be carefully evaluated and taken
   into account for both EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS deployments.
